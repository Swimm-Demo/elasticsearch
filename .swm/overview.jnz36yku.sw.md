The repo `elasticsearch` is a distributed search and analytics engine that is optimized for speed and relevance on production-scale workloads. It serves as a scalable data store and vector database, enabling use cases such as full-text search, logs, metrics, application performance monitoring (APM), security logs, vector search, and integration with generative AI applications.

## Main Components

### Server Core

Server Core refers to the essential components and functionalities that form the backbone of the server-side operations. It includes the main classes, methods, and resources necessary for the server to function, such as handling requests, managing configurations, and ensuring communication between different parts of the system. Server Core is crucial for maintaining the stability, performance, and scalability of the server.
